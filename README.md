I am an English teacher who has been passionate about computers since I was 4 years old. I live in EskiÅŸehir, Turkey. I started learning about programming languages and development. For now, I know HTML and CSS, but I can't wait to learn more languages, and I am really excited about it. I'm also planning to develop games in the future using Unreal Engine 5 or Unity. So wish me luck ðŸ˜€. I will update this readme file every month to inform you more about me ðŸ˜‰.

My future plans include learning:
- C#
- C++
- Javascript
- React

Also, I am developing some projects related to E-commerce websites, which you can check out in my workspaces. See you soon with new computer languages here... bye! ðŸ‘‹
