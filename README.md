I am an English teacher who has been passionate about computers since I was 4 years old. I live im EskiÅŸehir / Turkey. I started to learn about programming languages and developing. For now I know HMTL and CSS but I cant wait for further languages to learn and I am really excited about it. I also planning to develop games in the future by using Unreal Engine 5 or Unity. So wish me luck :grinning: I will update this readme file for each month to inform you more about me :wink:.

My future plans to learn: 

* C# 
* C++ 
* Javascript

  
Also I am developing some projects about E-commerce website's which you can check it from my workspaces..
See you soon with new computer languages here... byee ðŸ‘‹
